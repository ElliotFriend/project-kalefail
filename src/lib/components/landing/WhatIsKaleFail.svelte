        <p>
            Great question! If you take yourself far back to the olden days of November 2024, a new
            asset was sprouting from the ground: The blockchain superfood, also known as <code
                class="code">KALE</code
            >!
        </p>

        <p>
            A thought occurred to me in January, "wouldn't it be great to use <code class="code"
                >KALE</code
            >
            as a springboard to even more more exciting blockchain hijinks!?" KailFail is now an attempt
            to riff on the success and community surrounding <code class="code">KALE</code>
            in fun and interesting new ways. Every week, the goal is to experiment with some
            <em>new</em>
            and exciting way of utilizing <code class="code">KALE</code> for more.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's not a "fail" in that it's going to steal your vegetables from you. I'm not <em
                >trying</em
            > to be unsuccessful.
        </p>

        <p>
            No, it's a "fail" in that it's scrappy. It's experimental. It's moving fast. It's <em
                >fun</em
            >!
